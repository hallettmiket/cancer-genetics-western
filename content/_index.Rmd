Specific  genes, processes and cellular responses are routinely mutated in cancer. This
subverts normal cellular physiology creating characteristic alterations called ‘hallmarks’ that
enable these cells to fuel the development of cancer. This course focuses on these underlying processes that alter gene function - and the functional pathways they affect - across a diverse range of cancers. 

<span class="newthought">By the end of this course,</span> you will have:
 
 -  an understanding of the hallmarks of cancer and their underlying genes and processes;
 
 - the capacity to evaluate new reports and breakthroughs in cancer in a sound scientific manner;
 
 - a conceptual understanding of how cancer model systems and clinical samples have been investigated both traditional assays and also  modern "systems biology" approaches;
 
 - the capacity to explore cancer-related databases and models;
  
 - the ability to offer opinions and exhibit theoretical understanding of novel treatment scenarios;
 
 - the skills to communicate technical concepts and experimental results to diverse audiences.

# Course objectives 

[^cell_signalling_poster]
<span class="newthought">After some 45 years of research,</span> we now understand how genes with specific mutations govern a wide range of traits of cancer cells. Some mutations in some genes initiate carcinoma while other mutations confer existing tumors with new capacities that help it thrive. Techniques to study the genetics of cancers have advanced tremendously over this period. In 1975 it was a major effort to sequence a single gene. Now we routinely sequence hundreds of thousands of cells from a tumor genome. This capacity to characterize genotype to phenotype relations has given us the insight into why cancer cells behave the way they do.  

<span class="newthought">There tends to be a massive number of molecular differences</span> [^courseinfo]  between different cancer types, and even between individual tumors of the same cancer type. However, all of this molecular diversity manifests relatively few different molecular and cellular processes and responses. These are often termed the __hallmarks of cancer__. This course is organized around the twelve hallmarks. In particular, our goal is to explore these hallmarks, their underlying molecular and cellular processes, and their underlying genes, gene products and epigenetic components.


<span class="newthought">Cancer appears to be inherently difficult to "solve".</span> It remains a major research endeavour in academic settings, hospitals and research institutes, biotechnology firms and pharmaceutical companies. Yet even with all of this attention,  cancer still imposes great socioeconomic stress on individuals, families and societies. Perhaps this inherent difficultly originates from the fact that cancer is rooted in the laws of organismal development which have evolved at the least since the emergence of multicellular organisms. The disease exploits the same processes that made humans so interesting and powerful.

The goals in this course are

- to survey the molecular components of the hallmarks of cancer, 

- to gain knowledge of the model systems used to study cancers, 

- to understand the technologies and assays for studying model systems and clinical samples, and

- to understand how  this information is synthesized and integrated to capture salient aspects of the human disease.

The  lectures, assignments, project and examinations are structured to provide students with 
the capacity to evaluate new reports and breakthroughs in cancer in a sound scientific manner, and the abilty to offer opinions and exhibit theoretical understanding of novel treatment scenarios. Lastly, there is emphasis on developing the skills to communicate technical concepts and experimental results to diverse audiences. 
 
The full version of the following is available to OWL. The OWL website is the offical website for the course.

# Pre-requisites

Biology 2581b, Biochemistry 3381 or Pathology 3500

# Course materials

<span class="newthought">[Textbooks]</span>
We will primarily read papers from the primary literature. This includes review articles that provide scope and vision for the different hallmarks and their components. It also includes in depth research articles contributed by the individual lecturers who have been invited to speak about specific aspects of their cancer research. However, there are two excellent textbooks that I would recommend especially if you intend to continue in the field of cancer research. Both textbooks are classics in this field and provide a superb exposition of molecular cancer research.

[^weinberg_book] 
 
- [The Biology of Cancer, RA Weinberg, 2nd edition](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/9780815345282?gC=4cfad707612&gclid=Cj0KCQjwzLCVBhD3ARIsAPKYTcQgzdyQdUqNEYMZSG-rMKGPuUJfxJDiAessacL76Ug2LztON-AvPDAaAqFXEALw_wcB)

Be aware that a third edition of this textbook is about to be released; it was scheduled by the publishers for July 2023.

[^pecorino_book]

- [Molecular biology of cancer, L Pecorino, 5th edition](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/9780198833024?gC=4cfad707612&gclid=Cj0KCQjwzLCVBhD3ARIsAPKYTcToZTPkBp12P65AqGz6rYwJVP7XnGox2nU9dR_3nW6_Iro50SrGxbEaAvMqEALw_wcB)


<span class="newthought">[Literature Search Tools]</span> We will make use of resources such as 
[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/) to search through the literature. In the [resources](/resources/) section, there is a link to Western resources for accessing journal papers from outside of the Western internet domain.


<span class="newthought">[Computers]</span> We will make use of on-line cancer databases, portals and software throughout the course. The machine does not need to be powerful. Some of these sites are listed in  the [resources](/resources/) section. 

# Evaluation

[^bonus]
You can find descriptions and instructions for each exercise on the [assignments page](/assignments/). 
 
<span class="newthought">[Grading Scheme]</span>
```{r assignments-grades, include=FALSE}
assignments <- tribble(
  ~Points, ~Assignment,
  5     , "Early Quiz (in class, 30 mins)",
  15    , "Assignment 1",
  5     , "Project Proposal",
  15    , "Midterm  (in class 1 hour)",
  15    , "Assignment 2",
  20    , "Project",
  25    , "Final Exam"

)

```

```{r show-assignments-table, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
assignments %>% 
  select(Assignment, Points) %>% 
  pandoc.table(justify = "lc")
cat("Total pts: ", sum(assignments$Points), "\n")
```


# A  day in the life ...

1. There is a course forum available through OWL. This is a good place to ask questions. Moreover, we have a <i class="fa fa-slack" aria-hidden="true"></i> <a href="https://cancer-genetics-uwo.slack.com"> Slack</a> workspace and you can ask questions in the #general, in assignment specific channels (e.g. #assignment_1 channel), or by direct messaging me. If you have a Slack account registered with your UWO email, you should be allowed to join the ${\tt cancer-genetics}$ workspace by default.

2. Most lectures will begin (or end) with a 1 hour talk from an invited speaker on a specific aspect of molecular cancer. 

3.  The other half of the lecture will be used as a guided discussion of the required reading (which is almost always related to the invited speaker).

4. Office hours will be in person. I am actually accessible almost always via Slack and find this a more efficient way to communicate. If you would prefer to video conference, we can easily Zoom too.

5. Submission of assignments, projects and other material will be discussed as we progress through the course. This is done through OWL.



# Time management

As a rule of thumb per week (2 hours of lecture/week), 
 
- readings  requires $3$ hours; 
- lecture on average $2$ hours;
- assignment  work $3$ hours;
- project work $1$ hour;
- Slack questions or office hours (TA or instructor) $1$ hour;
- studying for midterms or exams $1$ hour per week.

In total over $13$ weeks, consisting of approximately $13 \cdot 11 = 143$ hours (credits $0.5$).


# Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, Fairness, Academic Honesty and other social issues

The OWL website contains several statements. It is very important that everyone read and understand these statements.

# Action items 

- Please read the Resources, Projects,  Assignments and Syllabus pages. In particular, the Syllabus has links to videos, reading material and other sources of information that benefit the course.


- Please familiarize yourself with the official OWL website.

# Action items  

- Remember that if you have difficulty accessing these articles, the course web page has advice to use the Western VPN.

- Be ready for the Quiz after the talk. It will be about 30 minutes in length and cover up to the end of Lecture 3 (however ever far I got).

# Points of reflection

I would recommend reflecting on the various points of reflection in preparation for the quiz.
